# Professional Portfolio

## Welcome to the Professional Portfolio

As employers want to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples to be able to review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position, a professional portfolio is a must! That being said in this application, when the portfolio is loaded, then the user is presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them. Also, when the links in the navigation are clicked, then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section. When the links to the section about their work is clicked on, then the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications. Furthermore, the developers first application image is larger in size than the others. Lastly, when the images of applications are clicked on, then the user is taken to that deployed application. Overall, this application is extremely useful in helped employees assessing potential candidates!
